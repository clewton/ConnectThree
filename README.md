# ConnectThree
AndroidCourse_v4 - I'm just pissing about learning android

A game of 0's and X's (Tic Tac Toe).
No plan for an AI opponent yet (actually is very easy for 0's & X's, but I want more than 3x3).
I plan for the ability for a board size of n*n.
I plan to make it work with Connect 4â„¢ rules.... when I can be bothered.
Maybe it will turn into a game of draughts.
